# SpaceShip-ARKit-
This is a very basic spaceship app created with Augmented Reality Kit. As soon as users open the app, the spaceship moves, fades in, and fades out. The spaceship also keeps track of this pattern constantly. In order to use this app, the users need to have physical iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad since the simulator do not have camera functionality.
