# SpaceShip-ARKit-
This is a very basic spaceship created with Augmented Reality. As soon as users open the app, the spaceship moves, fades in, and fades out. The spaceship also keeps track of this pattern. In order to use this app, the users need to have physical iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad because the simulator do not have camera functionality.
